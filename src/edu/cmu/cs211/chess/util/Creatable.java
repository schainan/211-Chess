 * In this way, anyone can create objects of the
 * specified class without using reflection in a type
 * safe manner by calling ClassName.FACTORY.create()
 * 
 * Additionally, the object returned by create should
 * either be initialized, or the class should define
 * an init(...) method which takes the needed arguments.
